The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but sometimes unexpected results occur due to unit inconsistencies or incorrect operator precedence. For example, `width: calc(100% - 10px);` works correctly, but `width: calc(100% - 10);` might not, because the second `10` lacks a unit. Another common mistake is forgetting to properly space operators within the `calc()` function. Incorrect spacing can lead to unexpected errors.
